In a typical air burst, where the blast range is maximized to produce the greatest range of severe damage, i.e. the greatest range that ~10 psi (69 kPa) of pressure is extended over, is a GR/ground range of 0.4 km for 1 kiloton (kt) of TNT; 1.9 km for 100 kt; and 8.6 km for 10 megatons (Mt) of TNT

The world needs to destroy our nuclear weapons. If we do not, we risk nuclear war with eachother and the world will not survive, save Australia and New Zealand. If we launch a nuclear war, Africa could survive, but they would have catastrophic damage reign on crops and life in general. This means that <b>many people will die</b>, if not the entire population. A singular nuke could destroy a city and kill most of it's people. If, say The United States Of <b>America and Russia</b> went into a nuclear war, <b>HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS</b> of people will die. <b>The availiable resources would plummet</b>, and there would be a <b>MASSIVE loss of life. </b>The <b>Safest</b> place to ve if the world goes into a nuclear war would be <b>Australia, Iceland, Solomon Islands, Vanatu, and New Zealand</b>. They have the infrastructure to survive without the aid of other countries, and they are far away from where nuclear bombs would be.

<h3 class="orange-question">How much would 1 Megaton destroy?</h3>
<p class="yellow-paragraph">It varies on the way the bomb is built, detonated, and the height and velocity of the bomb, however, the average 1 megaton bomb would destroy over 80 square miles. </p>
<h3 class="green-question">What Is The Most Powerful Bomb?</h3>
<p class="blue-paragraph">One nuclear bomb that could be <b>deadly</b> is the <b>Russian Tsar Bomba. </b>AKA: RDS-220 or Big Ivan. With a mass of <b>60,000 lbs</b> (27,000 kg), a length of <b>26 ft</b>(8m), a diameter of <b>6ft, 11in</b> (2.1m), and a detonation mechanism of a <b>barometric sensor</b>, It will detonate just before it hits the ground, both causing extreme damage to buildings all around, and producing nuclear fallout enough to kill 99% of a large city. The Tsar Bomba was <b>tested</b>, with 50 megatons (more than 50 million tons of TNT) of damage, More than 3,800x the strength of the <i>Atom Bomb</i> that the US dropped on Hiroshima During WWII. The 50 million megaton version would effectively destroy all of Luxembourg. The damage would be too catastrophic to test its full capacity: <b>100 Megatons. </b>(more than 100 million tons of TNT) There are three bombs currently being built by the Soviet Union called <b>AN602</b>. It is <b>estimated</b> to have <b>101.5 Megatons</b>. Thats more than the Tsar Bomba. If the Srar bomba was to detonate over a large city, like New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington D.C., the metropolitan areas along with the suburbs surrounding would be leveled and absent of life. The world would need 300 billion Tsar Bombs to destroy the moon. </p>

<h3>What Makes The Tsar Bomba So Strong? (rferl.org)</h3>
<p>"The Tsar Bomba was a hydrogen aerial bomb, also known as a thermonuclear weapon, which is usually described as a more advanced and powerful version of an atomic bomb. While atomic bombs use either uranium or plutonium in most cases, hydrogen bombs also need additional isotopes of hydrogen, called deuterium and tritium."</p>
<h3>What Is The Most Powerful Bomb In The US?</h3>
<p>The most powerful weapon in the USA is the B85 bomb. It could create a mushroom cloud 12 miles (20km) high. Over double the bomb of Hiroshima. </p>
